      <description>In this post we show how to fit a simple linear regression model using TensorFlow Probability by replicating the first example on the getting started guide for PyMC3. We are going to use Auto-Batched Joint Distributions as they simplify the model specification considerably. Moreover, there is a great resource to get deeper into this type of distribution: Auto-Batched Joint Distributions: A Gentle Tutorial, which I strongly recommend (see this post to get a brief introduction on TensorFlow probability distributions).</description>

      <description>In this post we want to revisit a simple bayesian inference example worked out in this blog post. This time we want to use TensorFlow Probability (TFP) instead of PyMC3.
