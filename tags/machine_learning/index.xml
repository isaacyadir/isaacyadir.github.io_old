      <description>In this post I present a concrete case study illustrating some techniques to improve model performance in class-imbalanced classification problems. The methodologies described here are based on Chapter 16: Remedies for Severe Class Imbalance of the (great!) book Applied Predictive Modeling by Max Kuhn and Kjell Johnson. I absolutely recommend this reference to anyone interested in predictive modeling.
This notebook should serve as an extension of my talk given at satRday Berlin 2019: A conference for R users in Berlin.</description>

      <description>I continue exploring the curse of dimensionality. Following the analysis form Part I., I want to discuss another consequence of sparse sampling in high dimensions: sample points are close to an edge of the sample. This post is based on The Elements of Statistical Learning, Section 2.5, which I encourage to read!
Uniform Sampling Consider \(N\) data points uniformly distributed in a \(p\)-dimensional unit ball centered at the origin. Suppose we consider a nearest-neighbor estimate at the origin.</description>

      <description>In this post I want to present the notion of curse of dimensionality following a suggested exercise (Chapter 4 - Ex. 4) of the book An Introduction to Statistical Learning, written by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani.
When the number of features \(p\) is large, there tends to be a deterioration in the performance of KNN and other local approaches that perform prediction using only observations that are near the test observation for which a prediction must be made.</description>
