      <description>Here I want to discuss my transition from Pelican to Blogdown and present some personal learnings. In June 2017 I decided to build a personal website/portafolio. I chose Pelican, because:
  It is written in Python, which was the programing language I was mainly working on.
  I wanted to include some Jupyter notebook I had already written.
  A great post: Building a data science portfolio: Making a data science blog explaining the procedure and using GitHub Pages to publist it.</description>
