      <description>In this notebook we want to go take a look into the distributions module of TensorFlow probability. The aim is to understand the fundamentals and then explore further this probabilistic programming framework. Here you can find an overview of TensorFlow Probability. We will concentrate on the first part of Layer 1: Statistical Building Blocks. As you could see from the distributions module documentation, there are many classes of distributions. We will explore a small sample of them in order to get an overall overview.</description>
